I would change the wording. 
'Software that was installed from outside of Ubuntu', since it upgrades other
packages if they are added to the repository list (which is common).

Autoupdates are setup by default for:
  Ubuntu base
  Ubuntu distribution for security - general, apps-security and infrastructure

General updates, proposed, and backports or other repositories are not updated 
automatically by default. 
   
The settings for unattended upgrades is in: 
    /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades

You can see packages that are available to upgrade by:
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ apt list --upgradeable

The following will update any package from Ubuntu, Lambda stack (if installed) or
other repositories added to the system (/etc/apt/soruces.list.d/* or /etc/apt/soruces.list)
    $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

And yes to the Examples of softwares it does not update:
    Software installed in virtual environments: pip, anaconda, python venv
    Software installed from a tarball
    Software built from source
