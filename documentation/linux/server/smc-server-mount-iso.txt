Som servers we ship do not have the license to allow mounting the ISO from the web interface.
  * We should provide this on all servers if possible.

A work around: 
  Download the Super Micro IMPI utility at the following url. 
  Running this utility on a separate linux machine, point to the IP address of the BMC/IPMI on the host 
     you want to upgrade.

   1. Download:
         https://www.supermicro.com/en/support/resources/downloadcenter/smsdownload?category=IPMI
   2. Uncompress the downloaded archive.
   3. Run the SMCIPMITool command:
      $ sudo /opt/SMCIPIMTool/SMCIPMITool IPADDR USER PASSWORD shell
           * IP_ADDR: the BMC/IPMI address for the machine to be upgraded
           * USER: ADMIN on Supermicro machines by default (same as used on the web GUI)
           * PASSWORD: Same as used on the BMC web GUI.
   4. Attach the virtual media in side the script:
       vmwa dev2iso /location/of/your.iso
       ** Do not exit SMCIPIMTool shell until you are fully done with the mounted ISO.
   5. From the machine you want to upgrade use the web GUI to reinstall.
   6. When install is fully complete, you can disconnect the virtual media:
       vmwa dev2stop
