====================
Partition new drives:
====================
1. Remove current partitions (if any):
  $ sudo fdisk /dev/sd[?]     (example 'sudo fdisk /dev/sde')
      remove partitions
2. Zero the superblock:
  $ sudo mdadm --zero-superblock /dev/sd[?]
3. Create a RAID partition 1 
$ sudo parted -a optimal /dev/sd[?]
   Place a flag gpt or mbr
      (parted) mklabel gpt
   Create partitions
    (parted) mkpart primary ext4 0% 100%
   Mark partition as software raid partition
    (parted) set 1 raid on
   Verify its alligned
    (parted) align-check
        optimal
         1
   Show results
    (parted) print

===================
Now add to the RAID:
===================
1. See what drives and raid level:
   cat /proc/mdstat
   df -h /dev/md0
2. Partition the drive and set it up for raid.
3. Add the Drive to the RAID (if it is raid md0 and this is sde1
   mdadm --add /dev/md0 /dev/sde1
   * At this stage the drive should be a 'spare drive'
4. Look at the /proc/mdstat
   If it has a '(S)' it should be a spare drive
5. Grow the RAID to let this drive be part of the RAID array (assuming this is the 5th drive)
   mdadm --grow --raid-devices=5 /dev/md0
6. Confirm expanded:
   cat /proc/mdstat
   df -h /dev/md0
