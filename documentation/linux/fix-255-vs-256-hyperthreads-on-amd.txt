One way is Disable SMT in the BIOS, it will disable 'Hyperthreads':
Hyperthread is having 2 threads per core. 
   * Hyperthreading works great on desktops or applications that have dangling threads (not active compute).
       - threads context switch to use the core (real hardware)
   * Disabling Hyperthreading works for most codes, that are one-for-one active computing, where the 
       - thread can be dedicated to the core.
       - There can still be too many processes requiring swapping out, then hyperthreading would have been better.
       - Many C/C++/Fortran-MPI-CUDA do better with SMT Disabled, but not all.
       - Other tricks in High performance computing is using numactl to lock processes to cores so they do not interfere 
         for example a daemon.  But also application layout and associated memory.


Here is the step-by-step: (This can vary depending on the Chassis type):

  -> Change the BIOS to enable X2APIC - see below for the place in the manual
  -> Change the BIOS to enable IOMMU - see below for the place in the manual
  -> Change the kernel to add amd_iommu=on:
     $ /etc/default/grub: add 'amd_iommu=on' to the line:
         GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="root=* quiet splash *
  $ sudo sed -iE '/^GRUB_CMDLINE.*DEFAULT/ s/"$/ amd_iommu=on"/' /etc/default/grub
  $ sudo update-grub
  ...
  $ sudo reboot
 
For the BIOS:
  Enabling IOMMU (page 92)  amd X2APIC (Local APIC Mode) page 85  in the BIOS:

       From the Manual on "AMD CPS"
       IOMMU Enable/Disable the IOMMU function. Options available: Enabled/Disabled. Default setting is Disabled.
