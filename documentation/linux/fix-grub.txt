Here's how to reinstall the GRUB bootloader, which will allow you to boot into Ubuntu

### 1. Create a bootable USB of Ubuntu(or any flavor of Linux)
We discuss creating a bootable USB [here](https://deeptalk.lambdalabs.com/t/create-usb-for-installing-ubuntu-18-04/482).

Creating a bootable [Ubuntu USB Drive from linux](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu#1-overview)
For creating a bootable USB from Windows, see [here](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#2-requirements).

### 2. Boot into the live image
Boot into the bootable USB drive.
One of the first prompts when booting into the bootable USB will ask if
you want to **Install Ubuntu** or if you want to **Try Ubuntu without
Installing**. We'll go with **Try Ubuntu without Installing**

### 3. Mount the root partition:

Once we're in the Ubuntu "trial", we'll want to open up a terminal.

`lsblk`(list block) lists all of the disks/drives seen by your machine.
Open up a terminal and enter `lsblk` to see the existing partitions.

This is a snippet from `lsblk` on my machine:

```
...
nvme0n1    259:0    0 931.5G  0 disk
`-nvme0n1p1 259:1    0  512M  0 part
`-nvme0n1p2 259:2    0  931G  0 part
...
```

Given the size of `nvme0n1p1`, I know it's my *boot* partition, and that
`nvme0n1p2` is my *root* partition.

I mount the *root* part to the `/mnt` directory with the following:

```
sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p2 /mnt
```

Then I will mount the *boot* part to `/mnt/boot/efi`:

```
sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot/efi
```

### 4. Chroot(change root) into the directory.

In the terminal, run:

```
wget files.lambdalabs.com/scripts/arch-chroot && \
chmod +x arch-chroot && \
sudo cp arch-chroot /bin
```

This will install `arch-chroot`, which will make it easy for us to
`chroot` & update the GRUB configuration. Let's chroot into `/mnt`:

```
sudo arch-chroot /mnt
```

### 5. Install & Configure GRUB

In the `arch-chroot` shell, we'll run the following to install GRUB:

```
grub-install /dev/nvme0n1
```

And then to configure grub:

```
update-grub
```

### 6. Syncing & Umounting the disk:
Finally, run:

```
exit
sudo umount -R /mnt && sudo sync && sudo reboot
```
