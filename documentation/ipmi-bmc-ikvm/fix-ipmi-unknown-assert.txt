For the "Unknown #0xff | | Asserted" in your ipmitool sel elist

To fix this:
   1. Run the following command to verify that there is a both a
      upper and lower case 'ADMIN' and 'admin', respectively.

      # ipmitool user list 1
        ID  Name         Callin  Link Auth    IPMI Msg   Channel Priv Limit
        2   ADMIN         false      false        true       ADMINISTRATOR

   2. If there is only one user listed, add a new user for whichever is missing:
      using one of the command sets below:
      # ipmitool user set name 2 ADMIN
      # ipmitool user set password 2 (EnterADMINtwice)
      # ipmitool channel setaccess 1 2 link=off ipmi=on callin=off privilege=4
      # ipmitool user enable 2

     Or most likely:
      # ipmitool user set name 3 admin
      # ipmitool user set password 3 (Enter admin twice)
      # ipmitool channel setaccess 1 3 link=off ipmi=on callin=off privilege=4
      # ipmitool user enable 3

   3. Afterwards, run the ipmitool user list command and verify that the list
      displays both users:
      # ipmitool user list 1
      ID  Name         Callin  Link Auth    IPMI Msg   Channel Priv Limit
      2   ADMIN            true    false      false      Unknown (0x00)
      3   admin            true    false      false      Unknown (0x00)

   4. Check 'ipmitool sel elist' to ensure the errors have stopped.
      And you may wish to also clear the previous errors.
      # ipmitool sel clear
