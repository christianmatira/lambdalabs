1. What is the error message or behavior issue
   a. Slow
   b. Down
        * It does not show in 'nvidia-smi' 
              - rminit
              - does it show on the PCI Bus
        * Most common 'Xid 79 - fallen off the bus'
              - Check dmesg/kern.log for Xid's and GPU remaps or remap failures
              - reboot
              - run nvidia-bug-report - check memory errors/remaps
                   * check the 'nvidia-smi --query' portion
                     # Some nvidia-bug-reports have control characters so 'grep' does not play well to fix it:
                         $ cat nvidia-bug-report.log | col -b > nv.log
                         $ mv nv.log nvidia-bug-report.log
                     Then for A100's
                         $ grep -A 5 Remap nvidia-bug-report.log

                       * Remapping Failure Occurred	  : Yes 
                            - Likely GPU needs replacement or chassis for SXM based GPUs
                       * Remapping Failure Occurred	  : No
                            - Check how many errors (it can only have 8 remaps per row).
                            - watch the counted of Remapped errors but also the Aggregate/Volatile errors
