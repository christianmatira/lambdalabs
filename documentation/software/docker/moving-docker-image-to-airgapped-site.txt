For moving a docker image:
docker pull image:tag
docker save image:tag -o file.tar

Then on the new machine (airgapped)
docker load -i file.tar

Save those to a device that you can move to the airgapped location.
In the airgapped you can use those on the local machine or on a local registry server.

Setting up a local docker registry server:
