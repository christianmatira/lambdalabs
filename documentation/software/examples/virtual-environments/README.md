Lambda Stack currently is not versioned.

These are examples of how to do versioning with the following virtual environments:
   * Docker
   * Python venv
   * Anaconda/Miniconda

Also how to clear misc python modules that may have been installed without a virtual environment and could cause conflicts/issues for all python scripts.
