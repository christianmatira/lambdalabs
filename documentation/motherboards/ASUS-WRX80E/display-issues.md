```
1. Problem with the GPU (Each GPU has different connectors DPI, HDMI, Display Port(DP), and some with USB-C.
2. On the WRX80E motherboard specifically:
   a. There is a VGA switch - and if it was bumped with the packing during shipping for example
      We have seen issues with the display.
      -> Solution: Power off the machine and unplug.  Then Toggle the switch to Disabled
